# ðŸ“„ Prodigy-PDF

This repository contains a [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy) plugin with recipes for image- and text-based annotation of PDF files, as well as recipes for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract content from documents. The `pdf.spans.manual` recipe uses [`spacy-layout`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-layout) and [Docling](https://ds4sd.github.io/docling/) to extract the text contents from PDFs and lets you annotate spans of text, with an optional side-by-side preview of the original document and pre-fetching for faster loading during annotation.

You can install this plugin via `pip`.

If you want to use the OCR recipes, you'll also want to ensure that tesseract is installed.
